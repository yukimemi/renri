# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI agents (Claude / Codex / Gemini) working in this
repo. The yukimemi/* shared conventions live in the
`<!-- kata:agents:* -->` blocks below, sourced from
`yukimemi/pj-base` / `pj-rust` / `pj-rust-cli` via `kata apply` —
see those for git workflow, PR review cycle, build/lint/test
commands, release flow, and renri's own worktree usage patterns.

The sections above the marker blocks are renri-specific and
consumer-owned: edit them freely; `kata apply` won't touch them.

## What renri is

A unified CLI for managing parallel work across **git worktrees** and
**jujutsu (jj) workspaces**, configured by TOML files driven through
the [teravars] library so the same config can `include = [...]`
others, render `{% if system.os == "windows" %}` per-OS sections, and
expose `system.*` / `vcs.*` to the user's templates.

Name comes from 連理 (renri), the classical Chinese / Japanese image
of two trees whose branches grow into each other. Crate name `renri`,
binary `renri`, repo `yukimemi/renri`.

## Source layout

```
src/
  main.rs            — entry point: clap derive, top-level dispatch
  lib.rs             — module list (binary uses `use renri::...`)
  vcs/
    mod.rs           — Backend trait, Worktree row struct, VcsChoice
                        + select_kind() (Auto / Git / Jj override policy)
                        + open_backend() factory
    detect.rs        — walk-up search for .git / .jj; returns Repo {root,kind}
    git.rs           — GitBackend: `git worktree {list,add,remove,prune}` wrapper
    jj.rs            — JjBackend: `jj workspace {add,list,forget,root}` wrapper
                        + the missing `jj workspace prune` analog
  config.rs          — Config struct (layout + hooks) loaded via
                        teravars::load_merged from <repo>/renri.toml +
                        <config_dir>/renri/config.toml
  layout.rs          — origin-URL parser (SCP / https / ssh) + Tera
                        path renderer with vcs.* in scope
  hooks/
    mod.rs           — typed hook executor (HookRun context, run_all)
    copy.rs          — cross-platform file/dir copy with `src -> dst`
    symlink.rs       — symlink (Unix) / symlink + junction fallback (Windows)
    command.rs       — pwsh / bash / sh / zsh / cmd dispatch
  picker.rs          — inquire-based fuzzy fallback for missing args
  shell_init.rs      — bash / zsh / fish / powershell wrapper snippets
```

## Key design decisions (don't rediscover)

These were settled during the initial design pass. Flag with the user
before reverting any of them.

- **One verb set, two backends.** Auto-detect from `.git/` / `.jj/`
  presence; `--vcs git|jj` override. Colocated repos default to **jj**
  per ROADMAP — the jj working-copy model is the source of truth when
  both are present. `select_kind()` in `vcs/mod.rs` is the single
  policy point.
- **Naming convention default** is `~/wt/<owner>/<repo>/<branch>`,
  parsed from origin remote with fallback to current user's name when
  no parseable origin. All overridable via `[layout]` in
  `renri.toml`. Layout templates can use `system.os`, `system.host`,
  `vcs.*` so per-host / per-OS dispatch is one `{% if %}` away.
- **Hooks are typed** — `type = "copy" | "symlink" | "command"` in
  TOML, not raw shell strings. `command` is the escape hatch.
  `copy` / `symlink` are first-class because they're the most common
  use case and `command` would force users to write portability
  shims for `cp` / `ln`.
- **Interactive fallback for any missing required argument.**
  rvpm-style: `renri cd` opens an `inquire::Select` picker;
  `renri cd <name>` skips it. `--non-interactive` (or any flag we
  decide implies it) makes the missing-arg case an error. Picker
  TUI lives on stderr so stdout stays clean for shell wrappers.
- **`renri cd` prints the path on stdout**, designed for shell
  function wrappers like `cd "$(renri cd foo)"`. The `shell-init`
  verb emits a wrapper that does this automatically. The function
  uses `command renri` (POSIX) or `renri.exe` (PowerShell) to
  bypass the same-named function.
- **Deferred-template trick for vcs.** teravars's `load_merged`
  Tera-renders every string in the config at load time, but
  `{{ vcs.repo }}` inside layout templates needs to be deferred
  until the actual branch is known. We pre-populate the load-time
  context with `vcs = { owner: "{{ vcs.owner }}", ... }` so those
  references round-trip through Tera unchanged. `system.*` / `env(...)`
  / `{% if %}` blocks DO render at load time as expected.
- **Don't ship symlink-without-Developer-Mode for files on Windows.**
  Surface a clear error pointing the user at the right setting.
  Directories transparently fall back to `mklink /J` (junction) which
  doesn't need any privilege. This is documented in
  `src/hooks/symlink.rs`.
- **`[teravars] include = [...]`** is the namespaced fallback if a
  user's app config legitimately uses `include` as a top-level key.
  Both forms in the same file is `Error::IncludeConflict`.
- **jj `prune` is implemented manually** because there's no upstream
  `jj workspace prune`. We list workspaces and forget the ones whose
  root path is gone. This is one of the main reasons renri exists
  for jj users — flag with the user before changing how it behaves.
- **Every "is this upstream?" answer is only as fresh as the last
  fetch, so the commands that ask, fetch.** `add` fetches before
  resolving a `--from` base; `remove --merged` force-refreshes the PR
  cache; `remove` (both forms) fetches remote refs before
  `landed::Probe` compares patch-ids. That third one was missing until
  the fetch landed, and the symptom did not look like staleness: a jj
  workspace whose PR had *just* merged reported `MERGED — dirty` and was
  skipped, because the jj dirty carve-out is keyed on the **content**
  verdict, which was still comparing against yesterday's
  `origin/HEAD`. It read as "renri does not really support jj". The
  policy in `sweep.rs` was never wrong; its input was. Any new caller
  of `landed::Probe` needs the same treatment — and each fetch stays
  best-effort, so offline use degrades to the cached refs instead of
  failing (`tests/remove_merged_freshness.rs` pins both directions
  with a real repo, since no unit test can see this).
- **A verdict nobody refreshed is not printed as a verdict.** The
  corollary of the bullet above: single-target `remove -y` skips the
  fetch, because there `landed` only informs the prompt and `-y` means
  there is no prompt — so the panel prints `landed?` rather than
  omitting the flag, since an absent flag is how it says *not*
  upstream. `--no-fetch` still answers, from the cache, because asking
  for the cached answer is asking for an answer. Hence
  `print_worktree_details` takes `Option<bool>`: any future caller that
  cannot be bothered to look has to say so rather than pass `false`.
- **AI integration goes through APM.** The skill at
  `.apm/skills/renri/SKILL.md` is the single source of truth;
  Microsoft's [APM](https://github.com/microsoft/apm) compiles it
  into the right format for Copilot / Claude Code / Cursor /
  OpenCode / Codex / Gemini on `apm install yukimemi/renri`. We
  intentionally do **not** ship a parallel Claude-only `skill.md` —
  duplicate content drifts. MCP server is still a v0.2 item.

## renri-specific APM dogfood

Unlike most yukimemi/* repos that **consume** APM (apm.yml lists
`yukimemi/renri#main` as a dependency to pull the renri skill into
agent skill dirs), renri itself **publishes** that skill. So in
this repo:

- The single source of truth lives at `.apm/skills/renri/SKILL.md`.
- `cargo make apm-install` compiles it into `.claude/skills/` /
  `.gemini/skills/` / `.github/skills/` (the same step downstream
  consumers run).
- The compiled outputs are committed for visibility.
- `apm.lock.yaml` pins the resolution.
- `apm.yml` carries a **real, bumping version** (NOT the static
  `0.0.0` placeholder used by consumer repos), because
  `apm install yukimemi/renri@vX.Y.Z` resolves to the matching
  tag.

When the skill content changes, re-run `cargo make apm-install`
and commit the regenerated files. When cutting a release, bump
`Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, and `apm.yml` together, then tag.

## renri-specific tooling notes

The base / rust / rust-cli marker blocks below cover the
yukimemi/* common toolchain (cargo make, renri itself for
worktrees, jj-first workflow, release flow). Two repo-specific
elaborations that matter when working IN renri:

### jj-first colocation

This repo is colocated git+jj. `renri add` defaults to **jj**,
which creates a non-colocated jj workspace where `jj` commands
work and `git` does not — see
[jj-vcs/jj#8052](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/issues/8052) for
why secondary colocation isn't possible yet. Stick to the jj
default unless there's a specific reason to use git tooling.

### Hooks in jj workspaces don't fire

The pre-push hook installed by `cargo make hook-install` lives
in the main repo's `.git/hooks/pre-push`.

- **git worktrees** share that hook directory, so plain
  `git push` from a worktree triggers `cargo make check`
  automatically.
- **jj workspaces** push via `jj git push`, which uses libgit2
  directly and **does not fire git hooks**. From a jj workspace,
  run `cargo make check` manually before
  `jj git push --bookmark <branch-name>` — there's no automatic
  gate.

## Resilience principle

A single failure should not stop the whole tool, *unless* it would
leave the repo in an inconsistent state. Specifically:

- VCS detection failure → clear error pointing the user at `cd`-ing
  into a real repo.
- Layout rendering failure → bail; we can't pick a target path safely.
- Backend `add` / `remove` failure → propagate; the underlying VCS
  state is the source of truth.
- Hook failure → bail; partially-applied hooks are worse than none,
  and the worktree directory will likely already exist.
- `prune` per-entry failure → log and continue; pruning is best-effort.

## Useful invocations

```sh
# List worktrees in the current repo
cargo run --quiet -- list

# Show the resolved config + computed path for the current branch
cargo run --quiet -- config show

# Generate the bash wrapper
cargo run --quiet -- shell-init bash

# Override the default templates per-call (debug)
cargo run --quiet -- --vcs git list
cargo run --quiet -- --non-interactive cd main
```

## Version + changelog

Version lives only in `Cargo.toml`. `cargo check` refreshes
`Cargo.lock` after a bump. Commit titles follow
`<type>: <summary> (vX.Y.Z)` (e.g. `feat: ... (v0.1.0)`) so the
release surface is traceable from `git log`.

<!-- kata:agents:base:begin -->
## Shared conventions

This file is the agent-agnostic source of truth (per the
[agents.md](https://agents.md) convention). The matching
`CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` files are thin shims that point back
here so each tool's auto-load behaviour still finds something.
**Edit AGENTS.md, not the shims.**

### Git workflow

- **No direct push to `main`.** Open a PR.
  - Exception: trivial typo / whitespace / docs wording fixes.
- Branch names: `feat/...`, `fix/...`, `chore/...`.
- **PR titles + bodies in English. Commit messages in English.**
- **Releases are PR-driven and tagging is automatic** — in repos that
  ship a release pipeline. Bump the version in the project's own
  manifest in a `chore/release-vX.Y.Z` PR; on merge to `main` the
  language layer's `auto-tag.yml` detects the bump, pushes the
  `vX.Y.Z` tag, and that tag is what fires `release.yml`. **Do not run
  `git tag` by hand** — the bot tag will collide and the manual push
  fails. The specifics belong to the layers shipping those two
  workflows, which are not the same layer: `kata:agents:rust:*` for
  which file holds the version and for `auto-tag.yml`,
  `kata:agents:rust-{cli,lib}:*` for what `release.yml` builds and
  publishes. A repo with no `auto-tag.yml` has no release pipeline at
  all: nothing tags, and the version field in its manifest may well
  be decoration.

### Pre-merge review

Review happens **before the pull request, on the operator's machine**,
via [magi](https://github.com/yukimemi/magi). This layer no longer
ships PR-side review bots: `claude-review.yml` and `claude.yml` were
removed from it. Their scope was
human-authored PRs — their own job-level `if:` already excluded
`chore/release-*`, `kata-apply/auto`, `apm-bump/auto` and
Renovate / Dependabot — which is exactly the set magi reviews, so
keeping them meant reviewing the same diff twice, a
`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret per repository, Actions minutes on
private repos, and one trap that silently cost reviews: a PR editing
either workflow was skipped by `claude-code-action`'s
workflow-validation check and merged with a green check and no
review attached.

**"Removed" is a statement about this template layer, not about
every repo's current state.** Dropping a `[[file]]` entry stops kata
from managing the rendered file — it does not delete it. A repo that
had these workflows before this change keeps `claude-review.yml` /
`claude.yml` (and the `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` secret) under
`.github/workflows/` until someone deletes them by hand, and until
then they still fire on every human-authored PR. Check
`.github/workflows/` before treating a PR as unreviewed-except-magi:
if either file is still there, its comments are a real review, not
noise to ignore.

- **`magi review <branch>`** runs only the review + verification +
  gate half of magi's graph: nothing competes, no implementation, no
  judging, no vote. That is the mode for hand-written work.
  `magi run "<task>"` is the full competition, for work handed over
  whole. Both end at the same gate.
- What the loop actually does: each reviewer gets its **own detached
  worktree pinned at the commit under review** (no reviewer can
  perturb the tree, and the fixer never races one); `verify.e2e` runs
  in the branch's worktree and its output is fed to the fixer;
  finding ids (`R2-1-3`) are assigned by magi, not by the agent, so
  the fixer's adoption report can be matched against them; the loop
  is bounded by `review_rounds`; `verify.gate` must exit 0 before any
  merge is attempted.
- **`magi.toml` is repo-owned, not kata-managed.** Point
  `verify.gate` at the exact command CI runs, so a local pass means a
  green PR, and point `verify.e2e` at the invocation that actually
  covers the repo — feature flags included. A gate that differs from
  CI turns a clean magi run into a red PR, which is the one failure
  this arrangement cannot absorb.
- **If you did not run magi, the change was not reviewed, and nothing
  will tell you.** Do not open a PR for a hand-written change before
  `magi review` comes back clean; if you must, say so in the PR body
  and say why. What does *not* count as a substitute: a green CI run
  (it compiles and tests, it does not review), and CodeRabbit's
  silence.
- **CodeRabbit stays installed and is not part of the gate.** It does
  not auto-review repositories under 10 stars — the common case here —
  so treat it as absent unless it posts. When it does post, its
  findings are a real review: address them, reply **in the inline
  thread** with an `@coderabbitai` mention (the review-comment
  *replies* endpoint,
  `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<N>/comments/<id>/replies -f body=…`),
  and reply even when declining — say why, because a silent skip
  reads as overlooked. A "review limit reached" quota notice carries
  no findings and counts as quiet; re-trigger with
  `@coderabbitai review` when the quota refills if you want a real
  pass.
- **Read the report, not the exit status.** A reviewer seat that
  times out is logged as `WARN agent timed out seat=review-2` and
  then summarised as "raised 0 finding(s)" — indistinguishable from a
  genuinely clean pass in both the summary and `magi stats`. Check
  for timeouts before believing a clean round: a round where half the
  panel never answered is not a clean round.
- **Review artifacts stay local.** magi comments on a pull request
  only when it *stops* landing one. Findings, the fixer's adoption
  report and reviewer precision live in the run directory
  (`magi show`, `magi stats`). When the PR needs a record — a
  non-obvious fix, a finding declined with an argument — paste that
  part into the PR body or a comment yourself.
- With `merge = "pr"`, magi opens the pull request and keeps going:
  watches the checks, reads the review comments (human and bot), runs
  a bounded fix round when either is unhappy, pushes, and asks before
  merging. `land_approval` is on by default and **silence is a
  hold** — nothing merges unanswered. `magi answer` (or the web UI)
  is where it asks. Out of rounds leaves the PR open with a comment
  saying what still fails; `checks: unknown` never merges.
- **Merge gate**: magi's gate green — or CI green for a change magi
  never touched — **and** every review that did post resolved (a
  leftover `claude-review.yml`, CodeRabbit, a human) **and** the
  owner's explicit approval. The irreversible step stays a human
  decision.
- **No review-monitoring poll loop for bots this layer no longer
  ships.** The old loop existed to wait on them. Where a repo still
  has `claude-review.yml` (see above) the old cadence still applies
  until it is deleted; otherwise, after opening a PR wait for CI and
  report the wait state to the owner. When magi is landing the PR
  (`land = true`), magi does the watching.
- Bot-authored PRs (Renovate / Dependabot) need no review pass at
  all: CI green + owner approval.
- **Version-bump-only PRs** — a single `chore/release-vX.Y.Z` branch
  whose entire diff is `[workspace.package].version` /
  `[package].version` plus the matching inter-crate refs and the
  lockfile — likewise. There is nothing in a version bump for a
  reviewer to find, and the release pipeline downstream of merge
  (auto-tag → `release.yml`) is time-sensitive.

### Worktree workflow

> **Before your FIRST edit to any file, run `renri add` — NEVER edit the
> main checkout.** Read-only inspection (Read / Grep / Glob) stays on the
> main checkout; the instant you intend to *change* a file, you must
> already be in a worktree. The trap that keeps catching agents: diving
> into a fix the moment the diagnosis lands and editing in place. A
> concurrent agent shares the main checkout — your in-place edits will
> clobber theirs or be clobbered, and in a jj-colocated repo a stray
> working-copy commit entangles unrelated WIP into your branch. If you
> slip and edit in the main checkout, capture the diff first (jj already
> snapshotted it into the working-copy commit, so `jj diff > patch`; for
> git, `git stash` or save a patch — if you got as far as committing on a
> branch, just push it). Then reset the main checkout to pristine main
> (`jj new main@origin`, or `git switch -`), `renri add` a worktree, and
> re-apply the captured diff there.

Use [`renri`](https://github.com/yukimemi/renri) for any
commit-bound change. From the main checkout:

```sh
renri add <branch-name> --from main@origin            # create a worktree (jj-first), off latest upstream main
renri --vcs git add <branch-name> --from origin/main  # force a git worktree, off latest upstream main
renri remove <branch-name> -y --non-interactive  # cleanup after merge (agent-safe; see note)
renri prune                        # GC stale worktrees
```

Read-only inspection can stay on the main checkout.

**Always pass `--from <upstream main>`** (`main@origin` for jj,
`origin/main` for git). Without it, `renri add` forks off the *cwd
worktree's current HEAD* — in a long-lived main checkout that often
lags upstream, so the PR later shows up CONFLICTING against a `main`
that had already moved (e.g. a refactor merged upstream before the
branch was cut), forcing a manual re-port of the whole change.
`renri add` does fetch first, but fetching only updates `main@origin`
— it never moves the checkout's HEAD, so an explicit `--from` is what
guarantees a fresh base.

**Agents / non-interactive shells:** `renri remove` prints a details
panel and waits for a confirmation prompt — without `-y` it **hangs**,
and `--non-interactive` *alone* errors asking for `-y`. Always pass
`-y`, and add `--non-interactive` so a mistyped/omitted name fails
instead of opening a fuzzy picker (the same picker-fallback applies to
`remove` / `cd` / `exec` with no name). Use `-f`/`--force` to remove a
worktree that still has uncommitted changes or conflicts. To sweep
every merged-PR worktree in one shot: `renri remove --merged -y`.

### kata-managed sections

Several files in this repo are managed by `kata apply` from the
[`yukimemi/pj-presets`](https://github.com/yukimemi/pj-presets)
templates — the bytes between `<!-- kata:*:begin -->` and
`<!-- kata:*:end -->` markers, plus the overwrite-always files
listed in `.kata/applied.toml`. **Editing those bytes locally
won't survive the next `kata apply`** — push the change to the
upstream template repo (`yukimemi/pj-base` / `yukimemi/pj-rust` /
…) instead.

The marker scopes are layered, one per applied layer:
`kata:agents:base:*` is this section, and each layer adds its own
(`kata:agents:rust:*`, `kata:agents:rust-cli:*`,
`kata:agents:pnpm:*`, `kata:agents:firebase:*`, …). Which ones apply
*here* is a grep away: `<!-- kata:` in this file.

### This project's own conventions

Everything a layer ships is generic by construction: it describes the
stack the template assumed, not what this repo grew into. **Bytes
outside every marker pair are yours and survive `kata apply`** — so
project-specific conventions belong in a section of their own, outside
the markers (conventionally at the end of the file; if a later layer
appends its block below yours, no matter — kata only ever rewrites
between its own markers). Same mechanism as the `.gitignore` /
`.gitattributes` blocks.

Write those conventions down there rather than leaving them in one
agent's head, in commit archaeology, or in a README the agent will not
read. What earns a line:

- **Any layer default that does not hold here.** A layer states its
  assumption flatly ("Hosting is the primary target", "these rules are
  a placeholder to replace"). When the project has diverged, say so and
  say why — the layer's text keeps asserting the opposite on every
  apply, and an agent that only reads the blocks will act on it.
- **Facts duplicated across files with no compiler in between** — an
  address or a path that appears in code *and* in a rules/config file
  that cannot import it, a timeout that has to stay inside another
  timeout. List every copy, so the next edit finds them all.
- **kata-shipped files this project deleted on purpose**, together with
  the `once_applied = true` line in `.kata/applied.toml` that keeps
  them deleted. Otherwise someone helpfully restores one.
- **Shapes the runtime forces but no tool checks** — an export form a
  platform requires, import specifiers that must (or must not) carry a
  file extension, a directory whose contents are reachable by URL.
- **Invariants that money or access rest on**, naming the file and line
  that actually enforces them.
- **Which language the code speaks versus what a user reads**, when the
  two differ.

A repo whose `AGENTS.md` is nothing but kata blocks is a repo where
every agent re-derives all of that from scratch — and gets the layer
defaults wrong the same way each time.

### Rust workflow

This repo follows the shared Rust toolchain conventions. The
language-agnostic conventions block above (`kata:agents:base:*`)
covers git workflow, PR review cycle, and worktree usage.

### Build / lint / test

```sh
cargo make check                    # editorconfig-check + fmt --check + clippy + test + lock-check (the pre-push gate)
cargo make setup                    # one-time hook install + apm install
cargo build                         # debug build
cargo build --release               # release build
cargo test                          # tests; add -- --nocapture for stdout
```

`cargo make check` is what `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs and what
the local pre-push hook calls — anything that passes locally
should pass on CI and vice versa. Don't paper over a failing
clippy by sprinkling `#[allow(clippy::...)]`; fix the underlying
issue or push back on the lint with reasoning.

### Toolchain pin

The Rust toolchain is pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml` and the
project compiles with the `stable` channel. Don't introduce
nightly-only features without a real reason; if you do, document
the reason in the relevant module.

### Lint / format policy

`rustfmt.toml` and `clippy.toml` are kata-managed (sourced from
`yukimemi/pj-rust`). Edits to those files in this repo won't
survive the next `kata apply`; if a setting is wrong, push the
fix to `yukimemi/pj-rust` so every Rust project using these templates picks
it up.

### CI workflow

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` is also kata-managed. The source lives
in `yukimemi/pj-rust/.github/workflows/ci.yml.template` (the
`.template` suffix keeps GitHub Actions from running the source
itself in pj-rust); each Rust project receives the rendered
`ci.yml` via `kata apply`. Action versions are bumped centrally
by Renovate at `yukimemi/pj-rust` and propagate down on the next
apply, so don't bump them locally — Renovate is configured
(via the kata-distributed `renovate.json`) to ignore
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `.github/workflows/release.yml`
in each PJ to avoid the bump→clobber loop.

### Releasing: version bump PR + auto-tag

Releases are triggered from `main` by a Cargo.toml version
change. `.github/workflows/auto-tag.yml` is kata-managed (source:
`yukimemi/pj-rust/.github/workflows/auto-tag.yml.tera`). It
watches `main` and, whenever a commit lands that changes the
top-level `version = "..."` in `Cargo.toml`, it pushes a matching
`vX.Y.Z` tag — no manual `git tag` step is needed. The tag push
then fires `release.yml`; see `kata:agents:rust-lib:*` or
`kata:agents:rust-cli:*` for what release.yml does in each
crate shape.

Cut a release via a small PR — never `git push` the bump
straight to `main`, even though the base block lists version
bumps as an exception to "no direct push". `auto-tag.yml` only
fires on `main`-branch pushes, so the bump must land via a merge
either way; using a PR also gives CI a chance to gate the
release. Enable automerge so CI green = release start:

```sh
git switch -c chore/release-vX.Y.Z
# Edit `package.version` in Cargo.toml, then:
cargo build                     # let Cargo.lock follow
git commit -am "chore: release vX.Y.Z"
git push -u origin chore/release-vX.Y.Z
gh pr create --fill
gh pr merge --auto --squash --delete-branch
```

Once CI is green the PR auto-merges. `auto-tag.yml` then pushes
`vX.Y.Z`, which fires `release.yml`.

**In a workspace, the version is in more than one place.** A member
that is published and depended on by another member is declared
with both a `path` and a `version` — crates.io needs a
requirement it can resolve for somebody who is not building from
the checkout, so a bare `path` will not do:

```toml
my-core = { path = "crates/my-core", version = "0.4.2" }
```

That literal does not follow `[workspace.package] version`.
Nothing in Cargo makes it, and the release above will not either.

**It fails late and quietly.** `version = "0.4.2"` means `^0.4.2`,
so a stale pin keeps resolving through every *patch* release and
stops only at the first bump that crosses the minor — where
`cargo build` refuses with `candidate versions found which didn't
match`, in the middle of cutting the release. Two repos on these
templates hit exactly this, one of them three releases after its
pins were last correct, and the other had already written the
hazard down in prose and drifted anyway.

So bump the pins in the same commit, keep them in
`[workspace.dependencies]` rather than in each member, and assert
it rather than remembering it. A test is the cheapest place —
`cargo test` already runs in CI, and it needs no toolchain a Rust
workspace does not have. [pj-rust-workspace's
README](https://github.com/yukimemi/pj-rust-workspace#the-internal-version-pin-and-the-check-for-it)
carries one to copy into any member's
`tests/check_versions.rs`: `internal_pins_match_the_workspace_version`
fails when a pin and the workspace version disagree, and
`members_inherit_the_workspace_version` fails when a member writes
its own version or reaches for a sibling by path.

**Repo settings to set once:** enable
`delete_branch_on_merge=true` (Settings → General →
"Automatically delete head branches"). The `--delete-branch`
flag on `gh pr merge --auto` is effectively a no-op — gh
returns as soon as automerge is enabled, so the deletion has to
happen server-side, which requires the repo setting.

**Why `KATA_APPLY_TOKEN`:** GitHub refuses to fire downstream
workflows from tags pushed by the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so
`auto-tag.yml` pushes with `KATA_APPLY_TOKEN` (the same PAT
`kata-apply.yml` already uses). Each consumer repo needs a
`KATA_APPLY_TOKEN` secret set; if a version-bump merge silently
doesn't fire `release.yml`, the missing PAT is the first thing
to check.

### Rust CLI release flow

This is a Rust CLI crate, so the release pipeline is publish-aware.
`yukimemi/pj-rust-cli` ships a tag-driven release workflow in
`.github/workflows/release.yml` (rendered from
`release.yml.template` for the same don't-auto-execute reason
ci.yml uses).

Releases are triggered by a Cargo.toml version bump landing on
`main`. The bump flow itself (PR with automerge → `auto-tag.yml`
pushes `vX.Y.Z` → `release.yml` runs) is documented in
`kata:agents:rust:*` under "Releasing: version bump PR +
auto-tag" — that block also covers the `KATA_APPLY_TOKEN` and
`delete_branch_on_merge` setup. What `release.yml` then does for
a **CLI** crate:

1. Cross-compiles binaries for **three** targets — full triples
   `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`,
   `aarch64-apple-darwin`. Linux is musl (statically linked, so the
   binary runs on any glibc vintage); the Linux job installs
   `musl-tools` first. Intel Mac (`x86_64-apple-darwin`) is
   deliberately **not** built — Apple Silicon only.
2. Uploads them as a GitHub Release with auto-generated notes.
3. `cargo publish --locked` to crates.io using the
   `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` repo secret.

Set the `CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN` secret once per repo (`gh secret
set CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN`) before the first release. If the
crate is internal-only and shouldn't go to crates.io, either drop
the `publish` job locally (release.yml is `when = "once"` so the
edit survives subsequent applies) or set `package.publish = false`
in `Cargo.toml`.

The binary name is derived from the GitHub repo name at runtime
(`${{ github.event.repository.name }}`), so the workflow is
identical across CLIs using these templates unless your `[[bin]] name` in
`Cargo.toml` deliberately differs from the repo name — in that
case override `BIN_NAME` in the workflow's `env:` block.

### Release smoke target (`examples/smoke.rs`)

After `cargo build --release`, `release.yml` runs
`cargo run --release --target <T> --example smoke` on every build
matrix entry. `cargo test` runs only library code, so the produced
binary's startup path goes unverified — that's how shoka v0.10.0
shipped a rustls `CryptoProvider` panic to crates.io even though
all 13 CI checks were green.

The template's default `examples/smoke.rs` body is intentionally
no-op so kata can drop it into every consumer crate without
breaking releases. **Override it per crate** with the smallest
operation that exercises the regression-prone surface:

- HTTPS-using CLIs: build the API client (octocrab, reqwest, etc.)
  and issue a tiny no-auth GET — that forces the rustls handshake
  to run inside the same binary the release publishes.
- File-handling CLIs: write+read a temp file via the real I/O
  helpers (catches missing crate features, permission regressions).
- Pure library crates: leave as no-op.

A failing smoke blocks the release before publishing to GitHub
Releases / crates.io.
